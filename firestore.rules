/**
 * In this initial development phase, the rules are intentionally open to allow for rapid
 * prototyping and feature implementation without being hindered by security restrictions.
 * `allow read, write: if true;` means that any client, authenticated or not, can read,
 * write, and delete any data in the entire database.
 *
 * WARNING: This is NOT a secure configuration for a production environment.
 * Before deploying your application to the public, you MUST implement granular security rules.
 * This involves defining who can access which data and under what conditions, typically
 * by checking for user authentication (`request.auth != null`) and validating data schemas.
 *
 * The `isSignedIn()` function is provided as a starting point for when you are ready to
 * secure your database.
